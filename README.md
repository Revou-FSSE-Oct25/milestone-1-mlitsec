# RevoU student Portofolio

# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website project — a space where I showcase my journey as a **future web developer**.  
This website serves as my online presence, highlighting my background, skills, and future projects as I continue learning web development.

---

## 🧭 Overview

This project is a **personal portfolio website** built as part of the Milestone 1 task at RevoU.  
It represents my first step into the world of front-end web development — designed to be simple, elegant, and informative.  

The website includes four main sections:
1. **Home** – A brief introduction about me and the purpose of this website.  
2. **About Me** – A short biography describing my education, skills, and interests.  
3. **Projects** – A section where I will showcase my personal and collaborative works in the future.  
4. **Contact** – A contact form that allows visitors to send a message or collaborate with me.

This project will continue to evolve as I improve my coding skills and gain more hands-on experience.
