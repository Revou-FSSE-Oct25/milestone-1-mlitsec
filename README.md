# Personal Portfolio Website
Hi there!
This is my personal portfolio website a simple project I built to introduce myself and share my journey as I learn web development.  
It’s part of my learning milestone at RevoU, and also my first step in building an online presence as a developer.

---
## Overview
This website was created as a way to combine what I’ve learned about HTML and basic web structure.  
It’s designed to be clean, minimal, and easy to navigate, while also showing my growing understanding of how a website works.

The site includes a few main sections:
- **Home** – A short introduction about who I am and what I’m currently learning.  
- **About Me** – A brief summary of my background, skills, and interests.  
- **Projects** – A space for future projects I’ll add as I continue learning and building.  
- **Contact** – A simple form for anyone who wants to reach out or collaborate.

While the current version is quite simple, I see it as the foundation of something I’ll keep improving as I gain more experience.

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure for better readability.  
- A clean and simple layout with inline styling only (no CSS framework yet).  
- Placeholder form for future contact integration.  
- Ready to grow with new content and styling improvements.  
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages** for easy access and sharing.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – for the overall structure and layout.  
- **CSS (inline)** – for basic color, spacing, and typography.  
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and hosting.  
- **Markdown** – for writing this documentation.
